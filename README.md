# evidence-elive
An attempt to get the Evidence (the Enlightened file-manager) for Enlightenment, created by Azundris (http://www.azundris.com/), working again on modern Linux, in my case Elive Linux.

All credits for this program go to Azundris and her contributors, im not the original Author.

All credits for the libarys i used and modified, go to the Enlightenment team. https://www.enlightenment.org/about-efl.md

This is not really a fork, since im not able to port the application to modern EFL.
Im just trying to fix some code bits and creating workarounds to get the program to run.

Still work in progress. If you want to help out, feel free to do!
